        "\n",
        "# 1. Encapsulation\n",
        "# Definition: Encapsulation means bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, usually a class.\n",
        "# Purpose: It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, maintaining control over how the data is accessed or modified.\n",
        "# Example: Using private variables and providing getter and setter methods\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",

        "# 2. Abstraction\n",
        "# Definition: Abstraction involves hiding the internal details of an object and only exposing the essential features.\n",
        "# Purpose: It reduces complexity and allows the programmer to focus on high-level functionality.\n",
        "# Example: Using abstract classes and methods in Python with the ABC module.\n",

        "# 3. Inheritance\n",
        "# Definition: Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent).\n",

        "# 4. Polymorphism\n",
        "# Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through shared interfaces.\n",
        "# Purpose: It enables a single interface to handle different data types or classes.\n",

        "\n",
        "The Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python defines the sequence in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a class hierarchy. It is particularly important in multiple inheritance, where a class might inherit from multiple parent classes, each having the same attribute or method names. The MRO determines the order in which these classes are checked, ensuring that methods are consistently found and avoiding ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses the C3 Linearization algorithm to determine the MRO in new-style classes (those inheriting from object).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of the MRO\n",
        "When a class hierarchy is created, the MRO ensures that the correct superclass methods are used.\n",

        "The show method will be resolved according to the MRO. In this example, the order would be D -> B -> C -> A.\n",
        "\n",
        "Retrieving the MRO Programmatically\n",
        "You can access the MRO of a class using:\n",

        "1 .__mro__ attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "2 . The mro() method.\n",
